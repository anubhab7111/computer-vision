# computer-vision

This repository contains various implementations and projects in the domain of computer vision. The content is organized into folders based on the type of work, including implementations of popular deep learning models and OpenCV-based projects.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **`cnn/`**
This folder contains from-scratch implementations of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures:
- **LeNet**: A pioneering CNN architecture designed for digit recognition.
- **ResNet**: A deeper CNN model utilizing residual connections to address vanishing gradient issues in deep networks.

### 2. **`transformer/`**
This folder includes implementations of Transformer-based models:
- **ViT (Vision Transformer)**: An architecture that applies the Transformer framework to image recognition tasks.

### 3. **`opencv/`**
This folder contains additional projects and work related to OpenCV, a popular library for computer vision tasks. These projects demonstrate practical applications of image processing and manipulation techniques.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and the following libraries available:
- **PyTorch**: For deep learning model implementations.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
