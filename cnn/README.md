# CNN Architecture: LeNet and ResNet

This directory contains a scratch implementation of two prominent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures: **LeNet** and **ResNet**, designed and trained on the MNIST dataset for classification tasks.

---

## Features
- **LeNet**: One of the first CNN models, tailored for digit recognition.
- **ResNet**: A deeper architecture using residual connections to mitigate vanishing gradient problems.
- Implementation and training performed entirely from scratch.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: `mnist.ipynb` includes the complete training and evaluation pipeline.
